; Calculates the scores of candidates given in list L.

; The State variable is used to award bonus points depending on if the 
; candidates. Home state is the the same as the current primaries state or in 
; the same region as the primaries state.

; Returns the score of a single candidate
; Score is calculated as follows:
; Begin with a score of 0. If the candidate's home state is the same as the 
; current state, add 50 points. If the candidate's home state's region is the 
; same as the current state's region, add 20 points. Add 1 for every 10 
; commercials that have aired. (Round down to the nearest integer: 
; 37 commercials gives 3 points.) Add 1 for every day the candidate has spent 
; campaigning in the state. Add 5 for every primary or caucus the candidate has 
; won so far.
